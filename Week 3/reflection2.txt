The creation of the chatbot was interesting and was exactly what I asked for, from a certain point of veiw. However, it had no regard for the artistic part of having something be recognizable if one does not know what it is supposed to be. It is useful if you are able to phrase what  end result is desired clearly enouph. However, since it can not be artistic, it would be more helpful in making the smaller components/blocks that are then used to create the actual thing.
