I ended up selecting DeepAI as the image generator to be used. The image used is named cool3. I did try out some other AIs, but DeepAI created the image I liked the best. The interesting thing was that I gave all of them the same prompt of "pizza" and nothing else. It was easy to see that the AIs were not really able to handle it. One essentially gave me a picture of pizza and nothing else. The other tries just stuck random pizza in with what they normally generated. An example of that is seen with the picture I selected, which does fantasy landscapes. It still did the fantasy landscape, just with a random pizza. The AI ran into the same problem as with earlier weeks' attempts for AI-generated things, just with a diffrent context. It was still nonsenical and not very creative, but it just had a sligly better artistic starting point.
