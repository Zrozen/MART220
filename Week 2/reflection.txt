The foods that I got the bot to creat with pj5 came out interesting. The foods were closer to suggestions of the foods they were supposed to be, and for some of them, I could only figure out what they were supposed to be because it was labeled. The biggest difference was between what I created and its variant on pizza.  It seems like the chatbot focused primarily on core shapes, and in some cases colors, but obviously lacked the understanding of placement and integration.
